## Abstract (for paper)

We investigate the students' feedback process in the context of higher education within a design thinking process. Among other issues, the centralisation and accessibility of previous feedback students received on assignments proved to be challenging. Although, it is relevant for students to reflect on the feedback and take it into account when working on a new assignment. In order to facilitate the retrieval of feedback that students found helpful, a system that could be integrated into a virtual learning environment was developed. It allows extracting text passages from feedback and save them as so-called snippets, which students can later place in a sidebar when working on a new submission. Three prototypes of ascending fidelities were iteratively developed to demonstrate and adapt the concept. During the qualitative evaluations of the prototypes, the majority of the 24 participants stated that they liked the workflow and could imagine that the system could support them when working on their assignments.
